# Starling Savings

iOS application created as part of the Starling Bank technical challenge by Edward Danescu.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

First of all, clone this repository on your machine.
Then, If you have not already done so, please install cocoapods by running the following command in the terminal:

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Installing

Navigate to the repo directory locally and run:

```
pod install
```

This will add a pods folder to the directory, as well as the Starling Savings.xcworkspace file. Please only open this instead of he original Starling Savings.xcodeproj from now on.

## Running the app

Just start Starling Savings.xcworkspace and hit run. Note that you might have code signing issues, but these should be easily solvable from the "Signing and Capabilities" tab in TARGETS --> Starling Savings.
